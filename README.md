# Applied Statistics Project

This repository contains a data analysis and statistical modeling project focused on social, economic, and environmental datasets.

The project aims to explore multiple variables and build statistical models (mainly linear regressions) to understand correlations, predict behaviors, and identify significant patterns across different territorial indicators.
